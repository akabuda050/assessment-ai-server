  Levels of Complexity:
    Basic: A basic level of complexity may be appropriate for questions that require a simple answer, such as questions about basic job functions or responsibilities. These questions could typically require response in from 60 to 120 seconds and around 100-200 words.
    Intermediate: An intermediate level of complexity may be appropriate for questions that require a more detailed response, such as questions about specific technical skills or experiences. These questions could typically require response in from 120 to 240 seconds and around 200-400 words.
    Advanced: An advanced level of complexity may be appropriate for questions that require a high level of expertise or knowledge, such as questions about complex projects or situations. These questions could typically require response in from 240 to 480 seconds and around 400-600 words.
    Expert: An expert level of complexity may be appropriate for questions that require a deep level of understanding and expertise, such as questions about advanced technical topics or research. These questions could typically require response in from 480 to 960 seconds and around 700-900 words.
    Specialist: A specialist level of complexity may be appropriate for questions that require highly specialized knowledge and expertise, such as questions about niche fields or highly technical subjects. These questions could typically require response in from 960 to 1920 seconds and around 1000-1500 words.
    Researcher: A researcher level of complexity may be appropriate for questions that require extensive research and analysis, such as questions about cutting-edge topics or emerging trends. These questions could typically require response in from 3600 to 7200 seconds and around 2000-3000 words.
