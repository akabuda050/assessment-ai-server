              9.00-10.00: Completely relevant with no errors or omissions
            Completeness:
              0.00-0.99: Completely incorrect or is plagiarized or copied from any resources such as the internet
              1.00-2.49: Mostly incomplete with some relevant information
              2.50-4.99: Partially complete with some missing or irrelevant information
              5.00-7.49: Mostly complete with some minor errors or omissions
              7.50-8.99: Almost completely complete with only minor errors or omissions
              9.00-10.00: Completely complete with no errors or omissions
            Detail and Completeness:
              0.00-0.99: Completely lacking in detail and completeness or is plagiarized or copied from any resources such as the internet
